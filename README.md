# A Quick Guide to Wireframe Elements

A wireframe is the blueprint for a digital product.
It focuses on structure, not visual design.
It outlines four key elements:
**Layout**, **Navigation**, **Content**, and **Functionality**.

## 1. Layout Structure: The Grid

Layout is the page's backbone.
It organizes content into a clear framework,
creating order and visual balance.

* **What it is:** The grid, columns, and spacing.
    It defines where all elements live.
    Uses boxes as placeholders for future content.

* **Why it matters:** Creates hierarchy and consistency.
    This makes the interface predictable and scannable.

* **Example:** An e-commerce page with a two-column grid.
    A large box on the left holds the product image.
    The right column stacks the title, price, and CTA.

## 2. Navigation: The Guide

Navigation helps users move through the app or site.
It acts as the user's roadmap.

* **What it is:** The system of menus, search bars,
    and breadcrumbs (e.g., `Home > Products`).
    Also includes all interactive links and buttons.

* **Why it matters:** Prevents user frustration.
    Ensures content is easy to find.
    Maps the user flow and site architecture early.

* **Example:** A news site with a top navigation bar.
    The bar lists categories like "World" or "Tech".
    A prominent search bar sits in the header.

## 3. Content Placement: The Story

Content placement strategically positions elements.
It guides user attention and shows what's important.

* **What it is:** Arranging content by visual hierarchy.
    Often follows user scanning patterns,
    like the "F-pattern" for text or "Z-pattern" for visuals.

* **Why it matters:** Helps users find info fast.
    Directs users toward key actions,
    which impacts engagement and conversions.

* **Example:** A landing page using a Z-pattern.
    Logo top-left, Sign Up button top-right.
    A headline and image sit in the middle.
    A final CTA button is at the bottom-right.

## 4. Functionality: The Core

Functionality shows how interactive parts work.
It communicates element behavior to developers.

* **What it is:** Shows interactive components like
    forms, input fields, and CTA buttons.
    Can also include notes on element states (e.g., hover).

* **Why it matters:** Helps find usability issues early.
    Ensures tasks like sign-ups are smooth and intuitive.

* **Example:** A checkout page with labeled form fields.
    Shows a clear "Continue to Payment" button.
    Annotations can define error states, like a red
    border for an invalid email entry.

Wireframing in Practice: Early Usability Wins
Wireframing is key to fixing usability issues before development.

E-commerce Checkout Redesign
We reduced high cart abandonment by redesigning a checkout flow.

Issues Found (via Wireframing & Testing):
Redundant Data Entry: Users struggled with entering the same address twice.

No Progress Indicator: Users felt lost in the multi-step process.

Unclear Error Messages: Generic errors didn't help users fix input.

Solutions & Impact:
Streamlined Address: Added a "Billing address is same as shipping" checkbox, reducing effort.

Added Progress: Implemented a clear progress bar, improving orientation.

Improved Errors: Provided specific, actionable feedback, reducing frustration.

Conclusion: The Power of Wireframing
Wireframing helped us identify critical flaws early, allowed rapid fixes, 
and led to a more user-friendly checkout, directly solving the abandonment issue. 
It's the most cost-effective way to ensure a great user experience.

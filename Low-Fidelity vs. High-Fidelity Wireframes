Lo-fi vs. Hi-fi Wires: A Fast Guide
New app or feature? Know the diffs in lo-fi and hi-fi wires. It's key for a good design flow. Here's a fast look to help you pick the right type, at the right time.

📝 Lo-fi Wires: The Plan
Lo-fi wires are the first raw sketch of your app. They are basic, B&W lines for core form, grid, and flow.

Key Traits:

Raw & Basic: Uses plain shapes, lines, and filler text.

No Style: Skips colors, fonts, and art to keep focus.

Fast & Low-Cost: Made fast with pen or simple tools.

When to Use:

For early ideas and quick thoughts.

To check user paths and data maps.

To get fast team input.

Pros & Cons:

✅ Pro: Quick and cheap to make.

✅ Pro: Keeps focus on core use.

✅ Pro: Easy for all to make and add to.

❌ Con: Can be vague due to low detail.

❌ Con: Bad for tests that need visuals.

❌ Con: May not wow or be clear to all.

🎨 Hi-fi Wires: The Demo
Hi-fi wires are the slick, full versions that act like the final app. They use real art and style and are often clickable.

Key Traits:

Full & Real: Has set colors, fonts, art, and brand marks.

Clickable: Lets users do real tests.

Slow & High-Cost: Needs more skill, time, and pro tools.

When to Use:

Late in the design phase.

For user tests and final checks.

To show devs and deciders the final look.

Pros & Cons:

✅ Pro: Shows the final look with clarity.

✅ Pro: Lets you run real user tests.

✅ Pro: Makes the plan clear for devs.

❌ Con: Takes more time and cash.

❌ Con: Input can fix on looks, not use.

❌ Con: Harder and costs more to change.

💡 The Short Form
Use lo-fi first for a solid base and fast changes. Use hi-fi next to polish looks, test clicks, and prep for code. The right wire at the right time saves time, cash, and makes a better app.
